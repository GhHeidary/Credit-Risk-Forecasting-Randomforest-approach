# Credit-Risk-Forecasting-Randomforest-approach

### This script is an implementation of a random forest model for credit risk forecasting. The script uses various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Hyperopt.
## Installation
To run this script, you will need to install the following libraries:

    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    hyperopt

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn hyperopt
```

## Usage
To use this script, you will need to download the file named Credit_Risk_Forecasting_Randomforest_approach.py and save it to your local machine. You can then run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python Credit_Risk_Forecasting_Randomforest_approach.py
```

The script will download a dataset of credit risk data, preprocess it, and train a random forest model for credit risk forecasting. The results, including learning curves and confusion matrices, will be outputted to the console
